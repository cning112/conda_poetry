# Run "conda env create --file environment.yml" to create a conda env from this file

# To update the conda env after this file content is updated, run "conda env update --name <env_name> --file environment.yml --prune"
# Note that the --prune option is expected to cause conda to remove any dependencies that are no longer required from
# the environment, however this feature is broken since conda 4.4 (https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7279#issuecomment-516438069)
